Welcome to Board Game Banker (potentially-temporary name)

This project is in its infancy.  The eventual goal is to create a web app targeting mobile devices.  

The app would allow each player in a board game to keep score on her own device, and keep all scoring synchronized.  Instead of crowding around one device with a spreadsheet, each player can see scores and add/subtract currency from her own device.

Technology list:
- Database
	- MySql in production
	- H2 for testing
	- Up to developer for staging (MySql recommended to match production)

- Back end
	- Scala
	- Play MVC framework
	- Slick (data access)
	- Specs2 for testing
	
- Front end
	- Angular JS (JavaScript)
	- Jasmine for testing
	- Bootstrap (CSS/HTML)

Setup instructions:
0) JDK
	- Download and install a JDK.  I'm linking to 7 because 8 is allegedly unstable, but 8 should work fine too.
		(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
1) Scala/Play
	- Download and install scala 2.10.3
		(http://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.10.3.html)
	- Download and extract play framework 2.2.3
		(http://www.playframework.com/download)
	- Add the location of play to your PATH environment variable
		(Instructions: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)
	- Open a command prompt and type "play."  You should see a nifty dialog.  If so, proceed.  If not, 
		try again.

2) IntelliJ IDEA
	- Download and install IntelliJ IDEA.  Grab the community edition, or if you're feeling lavish 
		splurge on the ultimate edition.

3) The project
	- Fork the repository from GitHub.  Optionally, use the github app to do that.
	
4) Open the project in IntelliJ.  Ignore any warnings about modules not being backed by SBT.  
	Also ignore any offers to import existing modules.
		- First, build the project with play.  Open up the terminal in intellij, and type "play compile"
		- Now that the project is built, you're ready to run some tests.  Try running any of the provided
			run configurations.  If that runs successfully, you're set to go!
