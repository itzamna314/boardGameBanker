Welcome to Board Game Banker

This project is officially a [prototype!](http://board-game-banker.itzamna314.cloudbees.net/)

If you're playing a board game and can't find the monopoly money/pencil and paper/however else you keep score, use this app!
Instead of having everyone's score on a single device, everyone keeps score on their own device.

To begin, just enter an e-mail address at the homepage.  If you have used BgB before, you'll be logged in.  If not, you'll be prompted for a username and e-mail.  Submit these and you're ready to go!

To create a game, go to the add game tab and enter the e-mail addresses of your friends.  Then click create.  Each of them will receive an individualized e-mail with a link to join the game.  If they haven't signed up, they'll be prompted to do so.

If you are already logged in, you can enter your code manually on the Join Game screen.

To keep score, go to My Games, and pick the game you're playing.  Add/Subtract points with the appropriate buttons.

To update with other players' current scores, hit Refresh.

If you want to set up a dev environment to work with the source code, see the instructions in DEV SETUP.
